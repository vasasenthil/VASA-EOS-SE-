# LOG · CC-SPEC-001 working session log (§26.8)

## Phase 0 · session 1
- Read CC-SPEC-001 in full (cover brief + 28-section master spec). Confirmed it is a polyglot, distributed,
  infrastructure-heavy sovereign DPI — a different artefact in kind from the reference implementation.
- Executed Phase 0 (Bootstrap) per §24 + §26, stopping for human review per Cover STEP 3.
- Done: §11 monorepo skeleton with status-bearing layer READMEs; PHASE-0-PLAN; DECISIONS + ADR 0001–0005;
  BLOCKERS (infra/team/compute/network dependencies that gate Phases 1–8); SECURITY baseline; compliance
  MATRIX (§3); modules/CATALOGUE (§12) + 2 real module.yaml; **Rego policy plane** (access + regulatory +
  data/ai stubs + decision composition + opa tests); CI templates scaffold; reference→spec CROSSWALK;
  QUESTION-0001.
- Open: policy execution (needs OPA binary — B-023); everything in BLOCKERS Classes A–D.
- Blocked: Phases 1–8 (require sovereign infra + GPUs + clusters + a multi-disciplinary org + load rig).

## Phase 0 · session 2 (breadth, no infra)
- Built OPA 1.17.1 from source via the Go module proxy (release CDN was blocked) → policy plane now EXECUTES.
- Fixed a rule-conflict in policies/decision.rego; verified composed decisions live (deny/require-approval/permit).
- Generated the FULL 391-module catalogue (329 core + 62 TN) via tools/gen_catalogue.py → modules/catalogue.yaml
  + CATALOGUE.generated.md; 38 modules map to a reference-impl port source.
- Generated 11 OpenAPI 3.1 + 11 AsyncAPI 3.0 contracts (per domain, all 391 modules) via tools/gen_contracts.py.
- Completed the Rego corpus: data (classification/residency/retention) + ai (safety/bias/drift) with tests.
  Full suite: 27/27 opa test PASS; opa check clean.
- Added tools/lint_modules.py (CI gate: 391=329+62, contiguous ids, compliance/owner/layer/bundle, no drift)
  and tools/expand_modules.py (materialise per-folder module.yaml).
- Open: contracts are domain-level scaffolds (operation detail per module is later-phase); everything in
  BLOCKERS Classes A–D remains.

## Phase 1 · Foundation (L1–L2), authorable deliverables (§24)
- Built + tested the **sovereign-foundation services** (Go, stdlib-only):
  - `platform/L1-foundation/off-switch-svc` — M-of-N ed25519 quorum kill-switch, replay-safe, tamper-evident
    audit (ADR-0006). `go test` 7/7 PASS.
  - `platform/L1-foundation/escrow-agent` — deterministic, verifiable source-escrow manifest + Merkle-style
    root, tamper-detection (ADR-0006/§27). `go test` 4/4 PASS.
- Authored the L2 **IaC substrate** (ADR-0007): OpenTofu `infra/modules/{k8s-cluster,vault,istio,
  observability,argo-cd,cert-manager}` composed by per-site `infra/envs/{prod-chennai,prod-coimbatore,
  staging,dev}`; ArgoCD ApplicationSets + Loki PII-redaction values. Security defaults baked in (default-deny
  NetworkPolicy; Vault HSM/Shamir toggle defaulting to mock until B-002).
- Validation note: OpenTofu cannot be `go install`-ed here (replace directives in its go.mod) and there is no
  Docker/cloud substrate → HCL authored to valid syntax; `tofu validate` runs in CI against real providers
  (B-023). **Applying** any IaC is gated on B-001/B-002/B-010/B-012.
- ADRs: 0006 (off-switch M-of-N), 0007 (IaC: OpenTofu + ArgoCD GitOps). Layer READMEs updated honestly.
- **Build stops at the Phase-1 review gate** (Cover STEP 3/4): Phase 2 needs the cluster substrate + State
  PKI/HSM and `tofu validate` green in CI. Reference-impl green bar unaffected (tsc 0 errors).

## Phase 2 · Data Fabric & Security (L3 + L5), authorable deliverables (§18, §17, §8)
- Built + tested the **security data-plane** (Go, stdlib-only), operationalising the Phase-0 Rego corpus:
  - `platform/L5-security/pep` — Policy Enforcement Point over `data.vasa.decision`; single source of truth,
    **fail-closed**. Live-OPA integration proves PEP↔policy agreement (teacher-marks permit, expel-9yo deny,
    EWS-reject require-approval, minor-PII-no-consent deny). (ADR-0008)
  - `platform/L5-security/kms` — envelope encryption; HSM-root → per-tenant KEK → per-object DEK; tenant
    isolation, AAD binding, tamper detection, rotation/crypto-shred. (ADR-0008, §17.4)
  - `platform/L5-security/audit` — immutable hash-chain + Merkle root; detects tamper/delete/truncate/reorder
    (anchorable to Besu, B-020). (ADR-0008, §17.6)
- Built + tested the **L3 data fabric**:
  - `platform/L3-data-fabric/dataplane` — classification → store/region routing → retention; residency
    fail-closed. A **policy-parity test** cross-checks the Go router against the live OPA corpus → it caught a
    real gap (residency denied the in-state DR region); fixed `policies/data/residency.rego` to all
    TN-sovereign regions. OPA suite now **28/28**. (ADR-0009)
  - `platform/L3-data-fabric/schema/citus/001_core_oltp.sql` — tenant-sharded OLTP core, `FORCE` RLS,
    append-only `audit_log`, KMS PII envelopes. **Applied to real PostgreSQL 16**; RLS tenant-isolation +
    append-only audit proven functionally as a non-superuser role. `002_distribution.sql` (Citus calls)
    authored, CI-validated against a Citus image (B-013).
- CI: `.gitlab-ci/templates/go.yml` (gofmt · vet · go test w/ OPA · DDL apply). ADRs 0008, 0009. PHASE-2-PLAN.
- **Build stops at the Phase-2 review gate**: Phase 3 (L4 Integration/Federation) needs Citus/cluster
  (B-013/B-010), the State HSM root (B-002), and sovereign-DPI MoUs (B-022). Reference-impl untouched.

## Phase 3 · Integration & Federation (L4), authorable deliverables (§10.6, §20)
- Built + tested the **resilient federation adapter core** (Go, stdlib-only):
  - `platform/L4-integration/resilience` — circuit breaker (closed→open→half-open), bounded retry w/
    exponential backoff + jitter (context-aware, retryable classifier), idempotency dedup. Deterministic
    tests via injected clock/sleep. (ADR-0010)
  - `platform/L4-integration/reconcile` — faithful **PORT** of the reference drift engine: field-level
    (match/drift/missing, identity-critical escalation) + numeric tolerance (counts vs tighter money)
    reconciliation → Reconciled/Review/Flagged, advisory/HITL. (ADR-0010)
  - `platform/L4-integration/adapters` — APAAR anti-corruption adapter on the resilience core; DTO→domain
    transform. Exercised end-to-end against a **simulated upstream** (httptest): transform, retry-on-5xx,
    no-retry-on-4xx, breaker-trips-then-fails-fast, idempotent provision (no double-issue), drift flagged.
    Composes the two modules via monorepo `replace`.
- ADR-0010; PHASE-3-PLAN; L4 README + LOG updated to honest Phase-3 status.
- **Build stops at the Phase-3 review gate**: live upstreams/credentials/MoUs (B-022) and the GPU serving
  fleet for Phase 4 (B-011) remain gated. The remaining ~20 adapters follow the APAAR pattern on the same
  core. Reference-impl untouched; green bar holds (tsc 0 errors).

## Phase 4 · AI Engines & Serving (L8), authorable deliverables (§5, §10.7, §17.6)
- Built + tested the model-agnostic **AI serving + safety stack** (Go, stdlib-only), operationalising the
  Phase-0 `ai/*.rego` gates (which adjudicate signals this layer now produces):
  - `platform/L8-engines/guardrails` — PII detection+redaction (a model never sees raw Aadhaar/phone/email/
    APAAR), prompt-injection detection, safety scoring (Scorer seam). `SafetyGate` enforces
    `data.vasa.ai.safety.deny` via real OPA (fail-closed); 4 live-OPA integration cases pass. (ADR-0011)
  - `platform/L8-engines/evaluation` — PSI distribution drift (rollback > 0.2, matches `ai/drift.rego`) +
    disparate-impact / four-fifths (80%) bias + demographic-parity (feeds `ai/bias.rego`). Deterministic. (§5.1)
  - `platform/L8-engines/serving` — inference gateway: `Backend` seam (vLLM/Triton gated; deterministic
    `OracleBackend` baseline) + resilience (breaker/retry, reused from L4) + guardrails pre/post. Proven:
    PII redacted before serving, injection/age-inappropriate/unsafe refused at the input gate, fail-closed on
    gate error, retry on transient failure, **fallback to the oracle baseline** on sustained failure.
    Composes guardrails + resilience via monorepo `replace`. (ADR-0011)
- ADR-0011; PHASE-4-PLAN; L8 README + LOG updated to honest Phase-4 status.
- **Build stops at the Phase-4 review gate**: real LLM serving needs the GPU fleet (B-011); RAG/grounding
  needs Milvus (B-013). The `Backend`/`Scorer` seams drop in served models with no gateway change.
  Reference-impl untouched; green bar holds (12 Go modules pass, OPA 28/28, tsc 0 errors).

## Phase 5 · Agents & Orchestration (L9), authorable deliverables (§5, §6, §10.9)
- Built + tested the **agent layer under human authority** (Go, stdlib-only), a production RE-AUTHOR of the
  reference agent/tool-approval pattern:
  - `platform/L9-agents/registry` — the 6 native-AI agent specs (five-part anatomy, high-stakes flag) + an
    MCP-style tool catalogue where each tool declares a risk tier + the governance scope a human must hold;
    high-risk tools cannot register without a scope. (ADR-0012)
  - `platform/L9-agents/hitl` — the role-gated tool-approval queue: a proposed side-effecting call is queued
    pending; a human approves only if they hold the required scope (`*` superscope for apex authorities) →
    the tool executes; reject closes it; a failed execution stays pending for retry; every transition audited.
  - `platform/L9-agents/orchestrator` — the deterministic run state machine: auto-execute only low-risk,
    high-confidence, non-high-stakes proposals; route everything high-risk/high-stakes/low-confidence to HITL.
    Composes registry + hitl via monorepo `replace`. (ADR-0012)
- **Safety invariant proven**: the delegated system approver never holds the high-risk scopes (fund.release /
  compliance.sign / policy.sanction), so those tools — and the policy & compliance agents — ALWAYS require a
  scoped human, regardless of stated confidence.
- ADR-0012; PHASE-5-PLAN; L9 README + LOG updated to honest Phase-5 status.
- **Build stops at the Phase-5 review gate**: LLM-backed planning (LangGraph + MCP) runs on the L8 serving
  gateway once the GPU fleet exists (B-011); durable queue persistence lands in the Citus `agent_tool_requests`
  table on the cluster (B-013). Reference-impl untouched; green bar holds (15 Go modules pass, OPA 28/28,
  tsc 0 errors).

## Phase 6 · Knowledge, Notary & Verifiable Credentials (L7), authorable deliverables (§7.2, §16, §20)
- Built + tested the L7 **verifiability spine** (Go, stdlib-only):
  - `platform/L7-knowledge/graph` — curriculum knowledge graph (PORT): transitive prerequisites, deterministic
    topological learning path, readiness check; rejects unlearnable prerequisite cycles + unknown edges at
    construction. Neo4j is the production store (B-013). (ADR-0013)
  - `platform/L7-knowledge/notary` — Merkle-anchoring hash-chain ledger (the Besu seam, §7.2): each block
    commits to a Merkle root + the prev block hash; anchored roots get inclusion proofs a verifier checks
    against the root without trusting the ledger; `Verify` detects tamper/broken-link; forged proofs fail. (ADR-0013)
  - `platform/L7-knowledge/credentials` — ed25519 verifiable credentials anchored via the notary; end-to-end
    `Verify` confirms issuer signature + that the proof leaf is exactly the credential hash (binds proof to
    credential) + inclusion. Catches tampered claims, wrong issuer key, and substituted/unanchored creds.
    Composes notary via monorepo `replace`. (ADR-0013)
- ADR-0013; PHASE-6-PLAN; L7 README + LOG updated to honest Phase-6 status.
- **Build stops at the Phase-6 review gate**: live anchoring needs the Besu validator network (B-020); the
  graph persists in Neo4j + Milvus RAG (B-013); credentials push to DigiLocker (B-022). Reference-impl
  untouched; green bar holds (18 Go modules pass, OPA 28/28, tsc 0 errors).

## Phase 7 · Surfaces & Scale (L10), authorable deliverables (§10.3, §10.6, §10.8)
- Built + tested the L10 **scale spine** (Go, stdlib-only) — the design-time gate the load rig later confirms:
  - `platform/L10-surfaces/capacity` — analytical planner: sizes a topology (shards by data volume, app nodes
    by surge RPS, DB nodes by shard×replication, 30% headroom) and validates a proposed topology. Canonical TN
    load tested: 1.27 Cr / 69k schools → 17 shards / 207 app nodes / 67 DB nodes at modelled capacities. (ADR-0014)
  - `platform/L10-surfaces/ratelimit` — per-key token-bucket limiter (fair-shares tenants) + admission control
    that sheds load rather than collapsing under surge. Deterministic clock. (ADR-0014)
  - `platform/L10-surfaces/loadmodel` — the §10.8 scenarios (1 Cr × 1h, 2 Cr surge, 72h soak) as staged ramps
    + a deterministic arrival-shape model; the exact scenarios the rig runs. (ADR-0014)
- Scale posture is HONEST: "validated by model, pending the empirical rig run" — model + rig use the same
  numbers. The 13 portal surfaces RE-AUTHOR the reference app's UX (build/host gated on the cluster).
- ADR-0014; PHASE-7-PLAN; L10 README + LOG updated to honest Phase-7 status.
- **Build stops at the Phase-7 review gate**: the empirical 1-crore proof runs `loadmodel` on the dedicated
  rig (B-032) against the cluster (B-010); surfaces build/host need the cluster (B-010) + serving (B-011).
  Reference-impl untouched; green bar holds (21 Go modules pass, OPA 28/28, tsc 0 errors).

## Phase 8 · Cutover & Operations (final build phase), authorable deliverables (§24 Phase 8, §26.8)
- Built + tested the **operational spine** (Go, stdlib-only) — go-live logic the human team executes on real
  infra:
  - `platform/operations/cutover` — ordered, idempotent, reversible go-live runbook engine: each step has a
    precondition + action + verify + rollback; a failure rolls back completed steps in reverse (never
    half-cut-over); a re-run skips already-satisfied steps; every transition audited. (ADR-0015)
  - `platform/operations/dr` — Chennai→Coimbatore failover controller: grades the realised data-loss window
    vs RPO and promotion time vs RTO, refuses an unhealthy standby, and DRILLS non-destructively (no role
    change); failback restores Chennai. Residency holds across failover (both sites TN-sovereign). (ADR-0015)
  - `platform/operations/slo` — SLO + error-budget engine: success rate, budget consumed, burn rate (fast-burn
    alerting), and a deploy-FREEZE gate when the budget is spent. Canonical availability/latency SLOs. (ADR-0015)
  - `platform/operations/runbooks/go-live.md` — the go-live runbook with commissioning preconditions.
- ADR-0015; PHASE-8-PLAN; operations README + LOG updated to honest Phase-8 status.
- **Phase 8 is the final build phase.** On commissioning (BLOCKERS Classes A–D satisfied by the human team),
  the platform runs the go-live runbook under the cutover engine, the DR drill to prove RPO/RTO, and the
  error-budget release gate. The **authorable build is complete**; what remains is commissioning + the
  empirical proofs on real infrastructure. Reference-impl untouched; green bar holds (24 Go modules pass,
  OPA 28/28, tsc 0 errors).

## Platform merge · the composition root (every layer wired into one platform)
- Built `platform/integration` — the composition root that MERGES all 24 layer modules into one `Platform`
  and runs deep, tested, end-to-end workflows top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top (no layer left an island):
  - `New(cfg, decider, gate)` wires L1 off-switch · L10 rate-limit/admission · L5 KMS/audit/PEP · L7
    notary/graph · L9 registry/HITL/orchestrator · L8 serving · ops SLO/DR. The PEP decider + safety gate are
    injected, so the merged platform runs against the **real Rego plane** (CI) or fakes (unit tests).
  - **Admission (top-to-bottom)**: L10 → L1 → L3 residency → L5 KMS(seal PII) → L5 PEP → L5 audit → L9 HITL
    (EWS-quota review to a scoped human) → L7 (issue + anchor a verifiable credential). The platform is itself
    the HITL executor (approval → credential issuance).
  - **AskTutor (bottom-to-top)**: L10 → L8 serving(guardrails+oracle) → L7 knowledge graph (readiness + path)
    → L5 audit.
  - **ReconcileStudent** (L4), **EvaluateModel** (L8 drift/bias gate), **GoLive** (ops cutover audited via L5),
    **Readiness** (merges L10 capacity+loadmodel + ops DR+SLO + L1), **Disable/Enable** (sovereign off-switch).
- Tests: 12 deterministic end-to-end cases + 3 live-OPA composition cases (admit→credential, EWS→HITL→finalise,
  residency block, off-switch, rate-limit, tutor serve/refuse, federation drift, model gate, cutover,
  readiness). Cross-layer invariants proven on the whole: audit chain stays intact across a workflow, a
  high-risk action always needs a scoped human, PII never leaves TN, a disabled platform serves nothing.
- Green bar holds: **25 Go modules pass** (24 layers + integration), OPA 28/28, tsc 0 errors. Reference-impl
  untouched.

## Deepening · the 6 AI engines + 6 agents + closing omissions
- Built `platform/L8-engines/engines` — the **6 deterministic AI engine baselines** (RE-AUTHOR of
  `lib/ai/engines`): Reasoning (forward-chaining), Assessment (rubric scoring + mastery + bands),
  Personalisation (next-best objective), Policy (lever projection: coverage/cost/equity), Analytics (z-score
  anomalies), Conversational (grounded answer with citation; refuses ungrounded). 10 tests.
- Built `platform/L9-agents/agents` — the **6 agents** (Teacher·Student·Governance·Grievance·Policy·
  Compliance) composing the engines into advisory recommendations; Policy + Compliance are high-stakes and
  always require approval; low-confidence (e.g. ungrounded grievance) routes to a human. 5 tests.
- Wired both into the integration platform: `Advise` runs an agent recommendation through the orchestrator
  (engines → agent → orchestrator → auto-execute | HITL), the platform executor now runs any registered tool.
  Closed the two omissions: `EscrowManifest` (L1 source-escrow, verifiable) and `LoadScenarios` (§10.8 suite).
- Green bar holds: **27 Go modules pass** (24 layers + engines + agents + integration), OPA 28/28, tsc 0
  errors. Every brochure AI pillar — 6 engines + 6 agents — is now built, tested, and wired under human
  authority. Reference-impl untouched.

## Runnable · platformd (the merged platform as a live HTTP service)
- Built `platform/integration/cmd/platformd` — a small HTTP harness that mounts the composition root and
  serves the end-to-end workflows so the build can be exercised live: `/healthz`, `/readiness`, `/scenarios`,
  `POST /admission`, `POST /tutor`, and a one-click web console at `/`. Uses the live Rego plane when opa +
  `policies/` are present, else an in-process mirror, so it runs on any host.
- **Proven live**: ran the binary against the real OPA plane and curled the workflows — admit → permitted with
  a notarised verifiable credential (audit seq 1); EWS reject → require-approval routed to a human (TR-0001);
  offshore PII → residency block; tutor injection → refused. 6 httptest cases. Self-verifying status page also
  added at `public/platform-status.html` (27 modules · 213 tests, generated from the tree).
- Reference Next.js app `next build` verified green (exit 0). Reference-impl business logic untouched.

## Deployable · platformd metrics + container
- Added Prometheus `/metrics` to platformd (requests/admission/tutor/refused/errors counters + live
  audit-records, notary-blocks, SLO success-rate, off-switch gauges); 7 httptest cases incl. metrics.
- Authored `Dockerfile.platformd` (multi-stage, stdlib-only, distroless ~6 MB static binary — exact build
  command verified) + `fly.platformd.toml` to give the demo a public URL. Docker daemon itself is unavailable
  here (B-012), so the image isn't built locally; the build step compiles clean. Honest caveat documented:
  the demo host (Mumbai) is not the sovereign TN-SDC; no HSM/real datastores — in-process only.
- Green bar: 27 Go modules pass, OPA 28/28, tsc 0 errors. Reference-impl untouched.

## CI · gate the Go platform + policy plane + build the image
- Added `.github/workflows/platform.yml` (complements the existing Next.js `ci.yml`): on push/PR to main +
  `claude/**` it (1) checks `gofmt`, (2) `go vet` + `go test` every layer module (OPA on PATH for the live
  integration tests), (3) runs `opa test` + `opa check` on `policies/`, then (4) builds `Dockerfile.platformd`
  (pushing `ghcr.io/<owner>/vasa-platformd:{latest,sha}` on non-PR pushes).
- Verified every step locally as a runner proxy: gofmt clean · vet+test 27/27 · `opa check` ok · `opa test`
  28/28 · the image build command compiles. YAML + embedded shell validated. (GitHub Actions itself can't run
  in this sandbox; the image is built on the runner, which has Docker.)
- **CI confirmed green on GitHub's real infra** at 3b2bf2a (queried via the Actions API): `main` push run —
  job "Go modules + OPA policy plane" success (gofmt · vet+test ×27 · opa test · opa check) AND job "Build
  platformd image" success (built + **pushed `ghcr.io/vasasenthil/vasa-platformd:{latest,sha}` to GHCR**).
  `claude/happy-dirac-l37y0g` (push) and `claude/platform-foundation` (PR #5) runs also green. So the
  container I couldn't build locally (B-012) is a real published artifact, built on a clean external runner.
- Added CI badges + a "Run the merged platform" section (docker pull / go run / console / metrics) to the
  root README so the published image and platform are discoverable.

## L6 Platform Services (workflow · i18n/TMS · notifications), wired in
- Built three Go modules under `platform/L6-platform-services/`:
  - `workflow` — multi-tier approval engine (G1–G7), role + scope gated, reject-terminates, progress; a PORT
    of the reference governance workflow. 5 tests.
  - `i18n` — code-first localisation + TMS: `{var}` interpolation, fallback-to-default-locale, `Missing` +
    `Coverage` (translation gap). **Tamil first-class**, English fallback. 6 tests.
  - `notify` — notification dispatch: i18n-rendered body, channel-routed (inbox/sms/email seams), idempotent
    on an idem key, failed-send-stays-retryable; in-memory `InboxSender`. 6 tests.
- Wired into `platform/integration`: every admission outcome dispatches a **localised Tamil inbox
  notification** (idempotent per applicant/stage); the **G3→G5→G7 scheme-sanction** flow runs on the workflow
  engine (`StartSanction`/`ActSanction`, role+scope gated, audited). `platformd` exposes `GET /notifications`
  (Tamil inbox) + a console button. 7 new integration tests + 1 platformd test.
- CI: added QEMU + `platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64` to the image build so `docker pull` is native on
  Apple Silicon too.
- Green bar: **30 Go modules pass** (was 27 + workflow/i18n/notify), OPA 28/28, tsc 0 errors. Reference-impl
  untouched.

## L4 federation breadth · PFMS + UDISE+ adapters on the proven core
- Extracted a shared resilient `core` (breaker + retry + JSON GET) and added two adapters following the APAAR
  pattern: `pfms` (fund-flow: allocation/release/utilisation; tight money tolerance → leakage signal) and
  `udise` (EMIS school counts; roll-vs-EMIS gap → ghost-enrolment signal). DTO→domain transforms; exercised
  against simulated upstreams (transform, reconcile-within-tolerance, drift→Flagged, retry-on-5xx). 5 tests.
- `reconcile` gained `CompareEmisToEnrolment` (+ `EmisSchoolData`) — students critical, teachers/classrooms
  upstream-only context. 2 tests.
- Wired into `platform/integration`: `ReconcileFunds` (PFMS) and `ReconcileSchoolCounts` (UDISE+), audited.
  2 integration tests (fund-flow leakage Flagged + audited; 30% roll gap Flagged).
- Green bar holds: 30 Go modules pass (adapters now apaar+pfms+udise), OPA 28/28, tsc 0 errors. The
  "remaining adapters follow the same core" claim is now demonstrated, not just asserted.

## More breadth · DigiLocker + DIKSHA adapters + RTI civic Rego bundle
- Two more L4 adapters on the shared `core` (fetch-shaped, not reconciliation): `digilocker` (lists a
  learner's credential vault; DTO list → domain) and `diksha` (fetches a learning resource). DTO→domain
  transforms, tested vs simulated upstreams (transform, no-retry-on-404). 3 tests → adapters now 14.
- New **RTI Act 2005** Rego bundle (`policies/regulatory/rti.rego`, L12 civic): §8(1) exempt categories
  denied; §11 third-party info → PIO review; wired into the composed `pbac.rego`. Added a `PIO` RBAC grant.
  Fixed the `not … in …` undefined-field gotcha with an `exempt` helper. OPA suite **28→33** (5 RTI tests).
- Wired into `platform/integration`: `FetchLearnerCredentials` (DigiLocker), `FetchLearningResource` (DIKSHA),
  and `RTIDisclosure` (adjudicates rti.disclose through the PEP), all audited. 5 deterministic + 2 live-OPA
  integration tests (exempt→deny, third-party→PIO review against the real policy).
- Status page regenerated: **30 modules · 255 tests**. Green bar: 30 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## DIKSHA-backed tutor · the learning path cites real content
- Added a decoupled `ContentResolver` seam to the tutor + a `DikshaContentResolver` (concept→DIKSHA-id map
  over the resilient DIKSHA adapter). `AskTutor` now, after the knowledge-graph learning path, cites a real
  DIKSHA resource (title + URL) for the target — connecting L4 (adapter) → L7 (graph) → L8 (serving). Graceful
  degradation: an upstream failure or no-resolver just omits the citation; the tutor still serves. 3 tests.
- Status page: **30 modules · 258 tests**. Green bar holds (OPA 33/33, tsc 0). Reference-impl untouched.

## Token Engineering · the missing 4th discipline (per the native-AI-engineering diagram)
- Honest self-assessment vs the four interlocking disciplines (Spec→Loop→Context→Token): Spec strong;
  Loop+Context partial; **Token Engineering was the genuine gap**. Closed it.
- Built `platform/L8-engines/tokens` — the economics layer: **per-user equity budget** (every user gets the
  same guaranteed budget; a heavy user can't starve others), **prompt + semantic cache** (exact + normalised;
  cache hits cost ~0), **tier routing** (Cached/Standard/Premium by cache-hit + remaining budget), and an
  Indic-weighted token `Estimate`. Observable `Stats`. 6 tests.
- Wired into `AskTutor` (the serving loop): consult the equity budget + cache BEFORE any model call — a cache
  hit short-circuits the model for free; an exhausted budget refuses fairly (EQUITY-BUDGET, audited); a
  low-budget learner routes to the cheaper Standard tier. TutorResult now carries Tier/CacheHit/TokensCharged/
  BudgetRemaining. `platformd` exposes `GET /tokens` (meter stats). 3 integration tests.
- Remaining discipline gaps (next): the **Loop** iterative controller (ReAct/Plan-Execute-Reflect/Critic/
  Tool-Use-Verify) and **policy-bound hybrid retrieval** for Context; plus Spec's BPMN/Protobuf/model-cards.
- Status page: **31 modules · 267 tests**. Green bar: 31 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## All four native-AI disciplines closed (Loop · Context · Token · Spec)
Per the native-AI-engineering diagram (Spec→Loop→Context→Token). Token was done last turn; now the rest:
- **LOOP** — `platform/L9-agents/loop`: bounded **Plan→Execute→Verify→Reflect** controller — planner proposes,
  tool executes, a critic verifies, reflect-on-failure, **HITL checkpoints** pause consequential actions, all
  audited. Wired as `Platform.RunLoop` (audited via the chain; HITL checkpoint tested). 6 tests.
- **CONTEXT** — `platform/L7-knowledge/retrieval`: **policy-bound hybrid retrieval** — keyword (BM25-style) +
  graph expansion, then **tenant-isolation + classification filtering BEFORE grounding** (Milvus leg gated).
  Wired into `AskTutor` (`Sources`); proven the tutor grounds in a public doc and **drops** a class-1 PII doc
  and a cross-tenant doc. 6 tests.
- **SPEC** — `workflow.ToBPMN` (approval flow → BPMN 2.0 XML, well-formed) + `evaluation.ModelCard`
  (fairness + drift + attestation → deploy gate, Markdown). 2 + 5 tests.
- Added `docs/NATIVE-AI-DISCIPLINES.md` mapping each discipline to its modules.
- Status page: **33 modules · 288 tests**. Green bar: 33 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.
  Reference-impl untouched.

## Deepening the disciplines · 3-leg hybrid retrieval + agent-driven loop
- **Context**: completed the hybrid-retrieval triad — added the **vector leg** (`retrieval.VectorSource`,
  Milvus seam gated on B-013) fused with keyword (BM25) + graph; `NewHybrid(docs, graph, vector)`. The
  policy bound (tenant + classification) applies to the vector leg too — a strong vector hit on a class-1 doc
  is still filtered. Degrades cleanly to keyword+graph when no vector index. 3 new tests (retrieval now 9).
- **Loop**: a concrete **agent-driven remediation loop** — `Platform.TeacherRemediationLoop` wires the L8
  engines (Assessment + Personalisation) as the tool inside the bounded Plan→Execute→Verify→Reflect
  controller: assess → diagnose the weakest objective → plan remediation, audited end-to-end. Proven to
  diagnose `decimals` as the weak objective and complete. 1 integration test.
- Status page: **33 modules · 292 tests**. Green bar: 33 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Exercisable disciplines · platformd endpoints + Protobuf (Spec triad complete)
- `platformd` now exposes the new disciplines over HTTP: **`POST /retrieve`** (policy-bound hybrid retrieval)
  and **`POST /remediation`** (the agent-driven Plan→Execute→Verify→Reflect loop) + console buttons; seeded
  with a small public demo corpus. Verified **live** against real OPA: `/retrieve` → `[FRAC-1, DEC-1, DIV-1]`
  (cleared docs, fractions first); `/remediation` → `{done:true, next:"decimals", iterations:4}`. 2 httptest
  cases. Added `Platform.RetrieveSources`.
- **Spec triad complete** — added `contracts/protobuf/platform.proto` (gRPC contracts for Admit/AskTutor/
  Retrieve/Remediate; 11 messages, 4 RPCs), alongside the existing OpenAPI 3.1 + AsyncAPI 3.0. CI now runs a
  real `protoc` compile check on every push.
- Green bar: 33 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors; proto compiles. Reference-impl untouched.

## DAT-TN-001 seed data · the State's data at first boot
Read the full Data Architecture Brief (DAT-TN-001) and implemented the seed-data inventory + loader.
- `platform/L3-data-fabric/seed` — the SEED RULE engine: **signed** ed25519 manifest of per-seed SHA-256
  checksums; **idempotent** load with **rollback** (seed-version tags); **lineage** (source/steward/version/
  checksum/loadedAt + amendments); **synthetic never in production** (C.7 egress guard); **dependency-ordered**
  per §C.8 (S0→S4). 8 module tests.
- Real TN reference data seeded: **38 districts · 7 directorates · 22 scheduled languages (Tamil first) ·
  21 RPwD-2016 categories · NEP 5+3+3+4 · classes Pre-KG–12 · scheme catalogue · role catalogue · regulatory
  bundle list · governance/scheme/grievance/POCSO workflows**; large sets (385 blocks/3,800 clusters/69,000
  schools) as counts; Phase-4 Native-AI seeds carry a `Gated` BLOCKERS id (catalogue seeds; weights/vectors
  land with B-011/B-013). Committed `seed-manifest.yaml` (37 seeds) via `cmd/genmanifest`.
- Wired into the platform: it **loads the seed at boot** (productive only when OK), `Platform.SeedStatus/
  SeedManifestYAML/SeedLineage`, and `platformd GET /seed`. **Verified live: 32 production seeds · 191 records
  · ok:true** (5 synthetic seeds correctly excluded). 3 integration + 1 platformd test.
- Status page: **34 modules · 302 tests**. Green bar: 34 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## DAT-TN-001 §B.6 onboarding pipeline · the single chokepoint
- `platform/L3-data-fabric/onboarding` — the **12-step L4→L5 gate** every record passes before entering the
  data fabric (no side doors): schema → authenticity → rate/shape → classification (POCSO-aware) → consent
  (DPDP) → residency (egress-denied) → tenant resolution → policy gate → encrypt-at-rest → persist → audit-log
  → emit. **Any failure quarantines the record (not lost) and alerts the source steward + Compliance Lead.**
  Each step is a seam; 9 module tests.
- Wired into the platform with the **real layers** — dataplane (classify+residency), PEP (policy), KMS
  (encrypt), audit, notify (alert): `Platform.Onboard` + `platformd POST /onboard`. Verified: clean Class-3
  record passes all 12 steps; **Class-1 PII offshore → quarantined at residency + steward alert**; Class-2 PII
  without lawful basis → quarantined at consent; unsigned external record → quarantined at authenticity.
  4 integration + 1 platformd test.
- Status page: **35 modules · 315 tests**. Green bar: 35 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## DAT-TN-001 §F data-governance framework
- `platform/L3-data-fabric/quality` — **§F.1** named-steward register (per domain), **§F.2** data-quality SLAs
  (master completeness ≥99.9%, identity duplicate <0.01% / APAAR ≥99%, attendance ≥95%, marks ≥99%, audit
  integrity =100%, model-card =100%) with `EvaluateSLA`, and **§F.4** Great-Expectations-style checks
  (completeness · uniqueness · referential-integrity · value-distribution · freshness) whose failing rows go
  to a **quarantine bucket**. 6 module tests.
- Wired: `Platform.CheckQuality` runs the checks, grades completeness vs the domain SLA, audits, and on failure
  **quarantines bad rows + alerts the named steward + Compliance Lead** (notify). `platformd GET /quality`
  runs a demo over a dirty school sample → fails, breaches the master SLA, alerts the steward. 2 integration +
  1 platformd test.
- Status page: **36 modules · 322 tests**. Green bar: 36 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## DAT-TN-001 §D volume + scale model
- `platform/L10-surfaces/volumes` — **§D.1** per-entity record counts (~1.27 Cr students, 4.5L teaching +
  1.5L non-teaching teachers, 2.75 Cr parents, 69,000 schools, 6L sections, 6 Cr addressable citizens),
  **§D.2** nine annual transactional streams (attendance ~25–34B · assessment 10–20B · submission 2–5B ·
  communication 10–20B · grievance 1–10L · scheme-delivery 50–100 Cr · ai-agent-interaction 5–50B ·
  iot-event 1–3 trillion · audit-log 100–500B), and **§D.3** the six-tier storage plan (oltp · olap ·
  timeseries · object · vector · graph) with per-node sizing, `ValidateStorage` and a 2× backup/DR total of
  **16,450 TB**. 5 module tests.
- Wired: `Platform.VolumeModel()` surfaces the §D model validated at 500 TB/node; `Readiness` now folds in a
  **StorageOK** check (+ failing tiers + total TB) so go-live readiness reflects the brief's sizing.
  `platformd GET /volumes` returns the live model. 2 integration tests. Verified live: /volumes → 1.27 Cr
  students + 9 streams + 6 tiers; /readiness → StorageOK:true, TotalStorageTB:16450, GoLiveReady:true.
- Status page: **37 modules · 329 tests**. Green bar: 37 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## DAT-TN-001 §F.3 data-lineage / catalogue surface
- `platform/L3-data-fabric/catalogue` — a single queryable **data dictionary** that unifies the seed inventory
  (Section C), loaded lineage (source · version · checksum · load time · amendments), the Section E PII
  classification (with sensitivity labels), and the §F.1/§F.2 governance register (named steward + applicable
  data-quality SLAs) per asset. Queries: `ByCategory`, `ByPIIClass` (e.g. surface every Class-1 asset for an
  audit), `BySteward`, and `Trace` (transitive upstream provenance + downstream impact over the dependency
  graph), plus a `Summary` roll-up. Pure + stdlib-only. 4 module tests.
- Wired: `Platform.Catalogue` is assembled at boot over **every known asset** (production + synthetic dev
  fixtures), enriched with the just-loaded lineage — synthetic seeds show as inventoried-but-not-loaded.
  Accessors `CatalogueSummary/Assets/Asset/Trace`; `platformd GET /catalogue` (summary · `?list=1` ·
  `?asset=ID` · `?trace=ID`). 2 integration tests. Verified live: /catalogue → 37 assets, 32 loaded, 191
  records, 16 stewards, 5 SLAs; /catalogue?trace=SEED-GEOGRAPHY → downstream [SEED-OFFICES, SEED-SCHOOLS].
- Status page: **38 modules · 335 tests**. Green bar: 38 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## DAT-TN-001 §G AI-operational governance — model-card registry
- `platform/L8-engines/modelregistry` — the authoritative register of every model the platform may run, making
  the §F.2 **"no model in production without a signed card"** SLA enforceable. Each entry binds an
  `evaluation.ModelCard` (intended use + bias + drift + signed attestation) to **red-team evidence** and a
  lifecycle state machine (registered → pending-approval → deployed → retired; blocked/rejected). The transition
  into production is **fail-closed** and needs all three: the card-level gate (four-fifths fairness + drift
  under threshold + **signed** attestation), red-team evidence on file, and a **named human approver** (HITL).
  Live drift past threshold on a deployed model trips an **automatic rollback** to blocked (canary discipline);
  `IsServable` is the enforcement point (unregistered/non-deployed ⇒ never servable). 5 module tests.
- Wired: `Platform.Models` boots mirroring what actually runs — the deterministic safety classifier is carried
  through the full gate (red-team → request → human approval) to **deployed**; the GPU-served generative + Indic
  models are **registered but un-deployed**, awaiting their B-011 substrate + independent evidence (honest).
  Accessors `ModelRegistry/Entries/Entry/Servable/CardCoverage` (the last feeds the §F.2 SLA live);
  `platformd GET /models` (summary · `?list=1` · `?model=…`). 2 integration tests. Verified live: /models →
  4 models, 1 deployed, coverage 1.0; the classifier entry shows its full lifecycle history + human approver.
- Status page: **39 modules · 342 tests**. Green bar: 39 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## DAT-TN-001 §E consent, lawful-basis & retention register (DPDP)
- `platform/L3-data-fabric/consent` — the stateful **DPDP-Act-2023 ledger** complementing the dataplane's
  stateless classification. Per data principal + purpose it records a **lawful basis** (consent §6, or a §7
  legitimate use — legal-obligation / court-order / employment / subsidy / emergency) and enforces: **child
  protection (§9)** — a minor's consent needs a named guardian, and a `ChildProhibited` purpose (behavioural
  advertising) is refused for a minor; **withdrawal (§6(4))** — consent is withdrawable, a §7 basis is not;
  the **retention clock (§8(7))** — ending a purpose starts the per-purpose window, `RunRetention` sweeps +
  erases; and **rights** — right-to-access (§11) and right-to-erasure (§12, forced) with a **statutory hold**
  that blocks erasure either way. Immutable per-grant history; `LawfulToProcess` is the enforcement seam.
  6 module tests.
- Wired: `Platform.Consent` is seeded at boot with the standing purposes (enrolment 7y · attendance 5y ·
  assessment 10y · scheme-DBT 7y · AI-tutoring 1y consent-based · + a child-prohibited advertising purpose).
  Accessors `ConsentSummary/Purposes`, `RecordConsent/WithdrawConsent/LawfulToProcess/AccessReport/RunRetention`;
  `platformd GET /consent` (summary · `?purposes=1` · `?access=…`) + `POST /consent` runs the rights flow.
  3 integration tests. Verified live: minor consent under guardian → lawful → withdraw → not lawful (reason
  "consent withdrawn"), with full history + a §11 access report.
- Status page: **40 modules · 351 tests**. Green bar: 40 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## §E consent register threaded into the §B.6 onboarding gate (live lawful-basis enforcement)
- Added `consent.Register.HasLawfulBasis(principal, purpose)` — the live query the ingestion path uses to
  authorise per-principal personal data (DPDP §4). 1 module test.
- Rewired the onboarding `ConsentChecker` (`obConsent`) to consult the **live §E register** instead of a bare
  payload flag: Class-1/2 personal data now passes the consent step only with either a **§7 legitimate use**
  asserted by the source steward (`statutory:true` — UDISE+/APAAR bulk ingestion under legal obligation) or an
  **active per-principal consent grant** in the register (looked up by `principal`+`purpose`). A bare
  `consent:true` flag is no longer sufficient. Updated the existing onboarding tests + platformd demo
  accordingly and added an integration test proving the live path (no grant → quarantine at consent; record a
  grant → all 12 steps pass). Verified live: marks without a grant → quarantine at consent-check with reason
  "no active lawful basis on file for this principal + purpose"; Class-1 with §7 statutory → passes consent,
  blocked at residency.
- Status page: **40 modules · 353 tests**. Green bar: 40 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## §F.2 SLA board measured live (§G registry → §F.2 SLA)
- Added `Platform.SLABoard()` + `SLAStatus` and a `platformd GET /sla` endpoint that grades the §F.2 SLAs the
  platform can measure live **today**, honestly: **model_card/coverage** sourced from the §G model registry
  (the only production model is the signed, deployed safety classifier → 1.0, met) and **audit/integrity**
  sourced from the L5 hash-chain (`Audit.Verify()` → 1.0, met). SLAs that need operational telemetry pending
  their substrate are deliberately left off the live board rather than faked. 1 integration test. Verified
  live: /sla → model_card 1.0/met (source "model-registry (§G)"), audit 1.0/met (source "audit hash-chain").
- Green bar: 40 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Populate at §D scale — TN institutional estate + synthetic population (honest real/synthetic line)
- `platform/L3-data-fabric/population` — materialises the TN education estate so the platform is **populated
  end-to-end at §D scale without fabricating real personal data**. The institutional tree is **anchored to the
  real 38 districts** (`seed.Districts`) and distributes blocks/clusters/schools to hit **385 / 3,800 / 69,000
  exactly**, with TN-shaped UDISE codes (33…) and a realistic management mix (~65% Government / 15% Aided /
  15% Matriculation / 5% CBSE). People (students/teachers/guardians) are **synthetic by construction** — every
  id `SYN-`-prefixed, `synthetic:true`, anchored to the real estate but never production. The full §D.1 cohort
  (1.27 Cr students etc.) is a validated `ScalePlan`, not materialised. Deterministic. 5 module tests.
- Wired: `Platform.PopulationSummary/SchoolsInDistrict/SyntheticCohort` (tree built lazily once via sync.Once);
  `platformd GET /population` (summary · `?district=NAME` · `?cohort=N`). 2 integration tests. Verified live:
  /population → 38/385/3800/69000 tree_valid:true, mix 44,850 Govt etc., scale 1.27 Cr; ?district=Chennai →
  real-anchored schools with 33… UDISE; ?cohort=1000 → 1000 SYN-APAAR students anchored to real districts.
- **Honest note:** real reference/master data (districts, directorates, 22 languages, 21 RPwD, schemes, NEP)
  was already 100% real and test-enforced; this slice materialises the institutional tree on top of it and adds
  a labelled-synthetic population. Real population PII (actual crores of people) is **deliberately not
  fabricated** — it requires the live federated substrate (APAAR/UDISE+/PFMS) and data-sharing agreements,
  which remain gated/out-of-scope by design.
- Status page: **41 modules · 361 tests**. Green bar: 41 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Drive the populated estate through the live workflows (end-to-end estate exercise)
- `Platform.ExerciseOnboarding(ctx, n)` + `platformd GET /exercise?n=…` — materialises a synthetic cohort
  spread evenly across the **whole real estate** (all 38 districts) and drives every member through the **live**
  §B.6 twelve-step onboarding gate against the real layers: records a real DPDP **consent grant** per principal
  in the §E register, then classify → consent → residency → policy → encrypt → persist → audit → emit.
  Ingestion is per-source (per originating block, signed by the L4 adapter) so the rate-shape step buckets
  realistically. 1-in-20 records are routed offshore to exercise the fail-closed quarantine path. The counts
  are **observed, not asserted**. 2 integration tests.
- Verified live (n=1000): 1000 grants recorded · **950 onboarded (95%)** · **50 quarantined at residency**
  (the offshore tranche) · **38 districts touched** · 1000 immutable audit-chain records. This is the platform
  actually processing a populated estate end-to-end — real classification, lawful-basis, residency, audit —
  on clearly-synthetic, real-anchored data.
- Status page: **41 modules · 363 tests**. Green bar: 41 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Estate exercise extended to the full pipeline (onboard → admit → tutor)
- `Platform.ExerciseOnboarding` now drives each onboarded student onward through the **admission** workflow
  (issuing a notarised verifiable credential) and an age-appropriate **AI-tutoring** turn (grounded + safety-
  gated), bounded to a 500-student downstream sub-sample for responsiveness; rate limiting is keyed per
  district. `EstateExercise` gained `Admitted / CredentialsIssued / TutoringServed / TutoringRefused`.
- Verified live (n=600): 600 grants · 570 onboarded · 30 quarantined at residency · **500 admitted · 500
  verifiable credentials issued · 500 grounded tutoring turns served** · 38 districts · 1,600 audit records.
  The populated estate now flows through onboarding + admission + tutoring end-to-end on clearly-synthetic,
  real-anchored data. Strengthened the integration test to assert the admission/credential/tutoring paths.
- Status page: **41 modules · 363 tests**. Green bar: 41 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Conformance diff — CC-SPEC-001 Cover Brief + SYN-TN-001 Synthesis Brief → the Go build
- Read both briefs in full (Cover Brief CC-SPEC-001, 6pp; Synthesis Brief SYN-TN-001, 10pp) and produced a
  line-by-line conformance diff against the Go service mesh: `docs/CONFORMANCE-CC-SPEC-001.md`. Verdicts are
  evidence-backed (module path or BLOCKERS gate), in the briefs' own "ask for scrutiny" spirit.
- Headline (Go build only): L1–L10 application **logic** = high conformance (every layer has tested Go
  modules; physical substrate gated by design); **6 engines + 6 agents = full**; **8 pillars = 6 built / 2
  partial**; **access-control policy models = 4 of 5** (IAM gated); **Indian statutory = 6 fully tested / 3
  partial**; scale analysis + populated estate = full (physical load proof gated). Honest gaps called out:
  **T0–T6 tenancy hierarchy is partial in Go** (tenant-ids yes, hierarchy in TS); **L11/L12, 13 portals, 391
  functional modules, NDEAR-S 29/29 and the international registers are TS-app, not the Go mesh**; HSM/K8s/8
  datastores/GPU/Besu/IoT/Edge/DAO are gated by design.

## Closed the Go gap — T0–T6 sovereign multi-tenancy as a first-class module
- `platform/L6-platform-services/tenancy` — the seven-tier sovereign hierarchy (T0 Sovereign/off-switch → T1
  Secretariat → T2 Directorate → T3 District → T4 Block → T5 Cluster → T6 School), promoted from tenant-ids-on-
  records to a real Go module mirroring `lib/tenancy`. **Strict-chain invariant** enforced on `Add` (a node's
  tier must be exactly one below its parent; unique T0 root). **Downward governance** (`Governs`) is fail-closed:
  a subject governs itself + descendants only — never an ancestor, never a sibling. `BuildTN` materialises the
  tree over the **real estate** (`seed.Directorates` + `population` tree) → ≈73k nodes with tier counts
  1·1·7·38·385·3,800·69,000. 5 module tests.
- Wired: `Platform.TenancyTiers/TenancySummary/TenancyPath/Governs/TenantNode` (hierarchy built lazily once via
  sync.Once); `platformd GET /tenancy` (summary · `?path=ID` · `?governs=A&over=B`). 2 integration tests.
  Verified live: /tenancy → 73,232 nodes, valid:true; path(Chennai) → "Tamil Nadu (Sovereign) → School
  Education Secretariat → Directorate of School Education → Chennai"; governs(DSE, Chennai)=true;
  governs(Chennai, Madurai)=false. Conformance diff + status page updated to mark the gap closed.
- Status page: **42 modules**. Green bar: 42 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Closed the TS-only gaps — L11 governance · L12 civic · 13 portals · 391-module catalogue · NDEAR-S · alignments
Promoted six registers that previously lived only in the TS app into first-class, self-verifying Go modules,
wired into the composition root and surfaced on platformd:
- `L11-governance/govtiers` — G1–G7 governance tiers (mandate/composition/authority) + 3 AI Control Tower
  bodies + escalation paths. `GET /governance`. 3 tests.
- `L10-surfaces/portals` — the 13 role-tailored stakeholder portals (role · home · tier · grants). `GET /portals`. 2 tests.
- `L4-integration/ndears` — NDEAR-S 29 building blocks with sovereign/federated/pending posture, headline
  computed (26/29 addressed today). `GET /ndears`. 2 tests.
- `L11-governance/alignments` — GLO-TN-001: 12 international frameworks (SDG·UNESCO·PISA·STARS·GPAI·UNESCO AI
  Ethics·ESG) mapped to in-mesh evidence + posture. `GET /alignments`. 2 tests.
- `L11-governance/catalogue` — the 391 functional modules as families across the 7 tiers + Platform, counts
  **computed** to 329 core + 62 TN = 391 (self-verified, can't drift). `GET /modules`. 2 tests.
- `L12-civic/civic` — PII-suppressed public dashboard (from the real estate), k-anonymity cell suppression, RTI
  register with the 30-day statutory clock, grievance tracker, open-data (CKAN-style) catalogue. `GET /civic`.
  4 tests. Wired: `Platform.{GovernanceTiers,ControlTower,Portals,NDEAR*,Alignments,ModuleCatalogue,Public
  Dashboard,FileRTI,FileGrievance,CivicSummary,…}` + 3 integration tests.
- Verified live: /modules → 329+62=391 headline_match true; /ndears → 29 blocks (26 addressed); /governance →
  7 tiers + 3 bodies; /portals → 13; /alignments → 12 (6 instrumented); /civic → 69k-school PII-suppressed
  dashboard + 6 open datasets + live RTI/grievance. Conformance diff updated: L11/L12 and all six gaps marked
  closed (per-module Next.js UIs remain in the TS app, by design).
- Status page: **48 modules · 388 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Tenancy made enforcing — jurisdiction-scoped queries over the live estate
- Added `tenancy.Hierarchy.Descendants` + `LeavesUnder(id, level)` (the downward-governance subtree query) and
  `Platform.SchoolsGovernedBy(subjectID)` — the fail-closed ReBAC scope seam over the real estate: a subject
  tenant sees only the T6 schools in its subtree. `platformd GET /tenancy?scope=ID`. 1 module + 1 integration
  test. Verified live: scope=TN → 69,000 schools (sovereign); scope=TN-DIST-Chennai → 2,090 schools (proper
  subset, with a UDISE sample); scope=GHOST → 0 (fail-closed). The T0–T6 module now *enforces* jurisdiction
  over live data, not just describes the hierarchy.
- Status page: **48 modules**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Wired L9 grievance agent → L12 civic tracker → L5 audit (end-to-end grievance routing)
- `Platform.RouteGrievance(ctx, GrievanceInput)` — runs a citizen grievance end-to-end: the **L9 grievance
  agent** recommends a policy-grounded routing (L8 conversational engine over a governing-policy corpus), the
  grievance is **filed into the L12 civic tracker** at the resolved governance tier, and the routing is written
  to the **L5 audit chain**. Tier resolution: child-protection/POCSO → district; scholarship/DBT → directorate;
  field issues (meals/infra/RTE) → block; ungrounded → directorate + flagged for human confirmation (HITL).
  `platformd POST /grievance`. 3 integration tests.
- Made the L12 civic register a **per-Platform field** (`p.Civic`) instead of a package singleton, so RTI +
  grievance state is instance-scoped (fixed cross-test leakage). Verified live: meal-quality → block (cites
  MDM-QUAL); POCSO → district (cites POCSO-MR); both filed in the tracker + audited.
- Status page: **48 modules · 393 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Live /conformance self-check — the headline figures, machine-verified from the running mesh
- `Platform.Conformance()` + `platformd GET /conformance` — computes every CC-SPEC-001/Synthesis headline from
  the **live registers** and compares to the briefs' published figures, so the conformance claim can never
  silently drift: 12 layers · 7 governance tiers · 3 Control Tower bodies · 7 tenancy tiers (T0–T6) · 6 engines ·
  6 agents (live from `agentregistry.Agents`) · 13 portals · 391 modules (329 core + 62 TN, computed) · 29
  NDEAR-S blocks · 12 international alignments · 8 pillars (6 built / 2 partial). `HeadlinesMatch` is asserted
  by the test (which prints exactly which figure drifted on failure). 2 integration tests.
- Verified live: /conformance → headlines_match:true, all 13 rows OK, pillars 6/8 built. The markdown
  conformance diff is now backed by a runtime self-check.
- Status page: **48 modules · 395 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Grievance human-authority loop — ungrounded routings go through the real HITL queue
- An ungrounded / low-confidence grievance routing is no longer auto-filed: `RouteGrievance` now **enqueues a
  HITL request** (`grievance.route`, scope-gated) for a tier officer to confirm; the grievance is filed into the
  L12 civic tracker only when the human approves (the HITL executor's `grievance.route` branch). Policy-grounded
  routings still file directly. Added `Platform.DecideGrievance` + `PendingGrievances`; `platformd GET/POST
  /grievance-queue`. Updated/added integration tests (the ungrounded case now asserts the full queue→approve→
  file loop).
- Verified live: ungrounded grievance → routed:false, pending_approval:true, request_id TR-0001; queue shows it
  pending; officer DEO-Chennai approves → "grievance GRV-9 confirmed + filed at directorate"; civic tracker then
  holds it. AI assists; humans decide.

## Resolved roles fetch error + wired govtiers escalation into the scheme-sanction workflow
- **Fix (TS):** `app/governance/roles/actions.ts` — a configured-but-unreachable Supabase (offline preview /
  restricted network / paused project) threw "Failed to fetch roles: TypeError: fetch failed". Added
  `isDbUnreachable()` to detect network/connection failures and degrade to the demo role set in both the
  query-error branch and the catch, so the page renders. tsc 0 / eslint clean.
- **Govtiers → workflow (Go):** the scheme-sanction flow is now **register-driven** — its steps ARE the
  `govtiers.EscalationPath` for the decision's stakes. Added `approver_role` + `required_scope` to each G-tier
  so the register defines who signs; `SanctionDefinitionFor(highStakes)`, `StartSanction(id, highStakes)`,
  `ActSanction(in, highStakes, …)`, `SanctionEscalation(highStakes)`; `platformd GET /sanction?stakes=`.
  High-stakes → **G4→G3→G2→G1** (PMU→Director→Secretary→Cabinet); routine → **G4→G5→G6** (PMU→Architecture→
  Ethics), never the Cabinet. Updated l6 tests (4-step escalation to G1 + routine-path assertion). Verified
  live: /sanction?stakes=high → [(G4,DEO,scheme.recommend),(G3,DIRECTOR,scheme.approve),(G2,SECRETARY,
  fund.release),(G1,MINISTER,policy.sanction)]; routine → [G4,G5,G6].
- Status page: **48 modules · 396 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## /metrics extended — governance · conformance · civic gauges from the live registers
- Extended `platformd /metrics` with Prometheus gauges sourced live from the registers: per-item +
  aggregate **conformance** (`vasa_conformance_headlines_match`, `vasa_conformance_item{area=…}`),
  **functional modules** (391), **model-card coverage** SLA, **tenancy** (`vasa_tenancy_nodes`,
  `vasa_tenancy_valid`), and **civic** (`vasa_grievances_open/resolved`, `vasa_rti_open/overdue`,
  `vasa_grievance_queue_pending`). Extended the metrics test to assert the new gauges. Verified live:
  headlines_match 1 · functional_modules 391 · model_card_coverage 1 · tenancy_nodes 73232 · tenancy_valid 1;
  after filing a grounded + an ungrounded grievance → grievances_open 1, grievance_queue_pending 1 (the
  ungrounded one held in HITL).
- Status page: **48 modules · 396 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## k-anonymity person-level public statistic (L12 privacy guarantee on real population data)
- `Platform.PublicEnrolment(cohort, k)` + `platformd GET /civic?enrolment=1&cohort=&k=` — produces a
  publishable per-class enrolment statistic from a synthetic cohort and applies **k-anonymity small-cell
  suppression** (`civic.SuppressSmallCells`): any class with fewer than k learners is withheld, never
  published, so no open-data figure can single out an identifiable small group (DPDP-safe). 1 integration test.
- Verified live: cohort=1500/k=5 → all 15 classes published, none suppressed; cohort=30/k=5 → 0 published, all
  15 small cells suppressed. The L12 civic layer now demonstrably emits person-level public stats without
  exposing small groups.
- Status page: **48 modules · 397 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## RTI lifecycle (L12) — file → acknowledge → answer under the 30-day statutory clock
- Civic module: added `AcknowledgeRTI` (PIO acknowledgement; clock keeps running), `GetRTI` (status +
  overdue), `RTIRequests` (register list). 1 module test (acknowledge + list + still-overdue-after-ack).
- Integration: `FileRTI/AcknowledgeRTI/AnswerRTI/RTIRequests/RTIStatus` — every transition **audited** to the
  L5 chain; `platformd GET /rti` (list · `?id=` status incl. overdue) + `POST /rti {action:file|acknowledge|
  answer}`. 2 integration tests. Verified live: file → "filed" (clock starts) → acknowledge → "acknowledged"
  → answer → "answered" (overdue:false), each step audited; an answered RTI can't be re-acknowledged.
- Status page: **48 modules · 400 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Open-data CSV exports (CKAN-style downloads from L12 civic)
- Civic module: `SchoolsByDistrictCSV(tree)` (institutional aggregates: schools per district × management) and
  `EnrolmentCSV(dim, published, suppressed)` (k-anonymity person-level stat — suppressed cells rendered as
  "suppressed(<k)", never with a count). RFC-4180 via encoding/csv. 1 module test.
- Integration: `Platform.ExportDataset(id, cohort, k)` — only non-personal datasets are exportable
  (schools-by-district, enrolment-aggregates); unknown/PII datasets refused. `platformd GET
  /civic?download=ID` serves text/csv with a Content-Disposition attachment filename. 1 integration test.
- Verified live: /civic?download=schools-by-district → CSV w/ headers + real per-district mix (e.g.
  Chennai,2090,1362,312,312,104); /civic?download=enrolment-aggregates&cohort=30&k=5 → all small cells
  "suppressed(<k)". The L12 open-data promise is now downloadable + privacy-preserving.
- Status page: **48 modules · 402 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Scheme-DBT delivery workflow end-to-end (lawful basis → G-tier sanction → fund release → receipt)
- `Platform.DeliverDBT(ctx, DBTRequest)` — runs a welfare-scheme benefit end-to-end, **fail-closed** at every
  gate: validates the scheme against the seeded catalogue; requires a **§E DPDP lawful basis** (§7 subsidy) for
  the beneficiary (no money moves without one); **sanctions** the disbursement through the govtiers escalation
  (high-stakes → G4→G3→G2→G1 to the Cabinet, run on the real L6 workflow engine); **releases** funds on the
  local per-scheme `reconcile.FundLedger` (reconciled against PFMS when the adapter is live, B-022); mints a
  **verifiable, notarised BenefitReceipt credential**; and audits each step. Added `RecordSubsidyBasis`,
  `FundLedger`; `platformd POST /dbt`. 2 integration tests.
- Verified live: PUDHUMAI-PENN ₹1000 to a synthetic beneficiary → no-basis refusal first; after recording the
  subsidy basis → delivered:true, sanctioned:true, escalation [G4,G3,G2,G1], released/utilised 1000, receipt
  minted, audited. The §E consent register, G-tier escalation, L4 fund ledger, L7 credentials + notary, and L5
  audit all interlock in one welfare-delivery flow.
- Status page: **48 modules · 404 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## PFMS reconciliation surface (fund-flow leakage detection)
- `Platform.ReconcilePFMS(scheme, upstream)` + `platformd POST /pfms-reconcile` — reconciles a scheme's local
  fund ledger (from DBT deliveries) against the upstream PFMS figures (source of truth) using the L4 reconcile
  comparator: any money-field drift beyond the tight tolerance is **critical** (potential leakage/mis-posting),
  surfaced with a human-readable rationale for a reconciler. Advisory only — mutates nothing; audited. Upstream
  figures are supplied (live PFMS fetch gated B-022). 1 integration test.
- Verified live: after delivering ₹2000, PFMS=2000/2000/2000 → Reconciled (clean, 0 critical drift);
  PFMS utilised=900 vs local 2000 → Flagged, 1 critical drift ("Count drift beyond 1% tolerance on Utilised —
  investigate the local figure against the state master"). This is the brief's "no leakage, no manual
  reconciliation" made operational.
- Status page: **48 modules · 404 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## APAAR student-enrolment flow (federate → reconcile → enrol into the estate)
- `Platform.EnrolViaAPAAR(ctx, APAAREnrolment)` — an APAAR-anchored enrolment end-to-end, fail-closed:
  **reconciles** the upstream APAAR identity (source of truth) against the school's submitted record via the L4
  comparator and **blocks on any identity-critical drift** (no enrolment on a mismatched name/DOB/id — a human
  verifies); requires the **target school to exist in the T0–T6 estate** (UDISE = a real T6 leaf, district
  resolved from its T3 ancestor); records the **§7 legal-obligation lawful basis** (RTE/UDISE+); and issues a
  **verifiable, notarised EnrolmentRecord credential**. Every step audited. `platformd POST /enrol`. 3
  integration tests.
- Verified live: defaults → enrolled:true, reconciled:true, district Chennai, UDISE 33030004181, credential
  minted; name+DOB mismatch → refused, critical_drift 2 ("Identity-critical drift on Name, Date of birth —
  verify before trusting either copy"); unknown UDISE → refused. The L4 APAAR adapter, reconcile drift check,
  L6 tenancy, §E consent, L7 credentials+notary and L5 audit all interlock in one enrolment.
- Status page: **48 modules · 407 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Student 360 / journey view — one identity, one auditable record
- Civic: `GrievancesBy(filer)` query. Integration: `Platform.StudentJourney(apaarID)` assembles a learner's
  complete record across the verticals — the §E **lawful bases** (AccessReport), the **grievances** they raised
  (L12), and the full **audit timeline** of platform actions about them, reconstructed straight from the
  tamper-evident L5 chain (re-verified). Read-only + derived: the record can't show an action the chain doesn't
  contain. `platformd GET /journey?apaar=`. 2 integration + (civic GrievancesBy covered) tests.
- Verified live (after enrol → DBT → grievance for one learner): lawful_bases [enrolment/legal-obligation,
  scheme-dbt/subsidy], 1 grievance (block, open), 8-event timeline (enrol.apaar → 4× G-tier workflow → dbt.
  deliver → grievance.route), audit_chain_verified:true. This is the brief's "every directorate, every district,
  every school answers the same question with the same number" — the learner's single source of truth.
- Status page: **48 modules · 409 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Per-learner verifiable-credential wallet (signature + notary inclusion proof, verified on read)
- The platform now **indexes every issued credential by subject** (admission/enrolment/DBT receipts →
  `recordCredential`, wired into all three issuers). `Platform.Wallet(apaarID)` returns the learner's
  credentials, each **re-verified end-to-end on read** via `credentials.Verify` — the issuer ed25519 signature
  AND the notary Merkle inclusion proof — so any relying party can confirm a credential is genuine + tamper-
  evident, not merely listed. `platformd GET /wallet?apaar=`. 2 integration tests.
- Verified live (enrol + DBT for one learner): wallet count 2 — EnrolmentRecord (udise/class/category) +
  BenefitReceipt (₹1000 disbursed) — both valid:true (signature + inclusion proof), all_valid:true. This is the
  brief's "portable credentials (NFT)" — verifiable, portable, tamper-evident — made real on the notary.
- Status page: **48 modules · 411 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Credential-revocation registry (closes issue → anchor → verify → revoke)
- `Platform.RevokeCredential(credID, by, reason)` + `RevocationStatus` — the NDEAR-S credential revocation
  registry: a revoked credential is recorded (audited) and thereafter fails verification, **even though its
  ed25519 signature + notary inclusion proof remain mathematically valid** (revocation is an authoritative
  status the verifier must consult). The wallet folds it in: a revoked entry is `valid:false, revoked:true`
  with a `REVOKED` failure, and the wallet is no longer all-valid. `platformd POST /revoke`. 2 integration
  tests.
- Verified live: enrolment credential valid:true → revoke (by DEO-Chennai, audited) → wallet shows valid:false,
  revoked:true, failures [REVOKED], all_valid:false. The credential lifecycle (issue → anchor → verify →
  revoke) is now complete and trust-correct.
- Status page: **48 modules · 413 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Student transfer / portability ("a child who moves … does not start over")
- `Platform.TransferStudent(ctx, TransferRequest)` — moves a learner between schools while **preserving their
  journey**: validates the destination is a real T6 school in the estate; **revokes** the prior enrolment
  credential (kept in the wallet, flagged revoked); issues a **fresh enrolment credential at the new school**
  under the same APAAR id (so wallet + journey + lawful basis carry across); resolves both districts; audits
  the move. Enrolment credential ids are now school-specific (`ENR-<apaar>-<udise>`) so transfers produce
  distinct records. `platformd POST /transfer`. 2 integration tests.
- Verified live: Tirunelveli → Tiruvallur — transferred:true, old cred (…-33300053701) revoked, new cred
  (…-33330059101) valid, history_preserved:true; the wallet shows the revoked prior enrolment + the valid new
  one, and the journey grows (does not reset). Exactly the brief's portable-identity promise.
- Status page: **48 modules · 415 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Cohort analytics / early-warning surface (L8 anomaly detection over the estate)
- `Platform.CohortAnomalies(indicator, z)` + `platformd GET /cohort-analytics?indicator=&z=` — runs the L8
  analytics **z-score anomaly detector** (`engines.Anomalies`) over a per-district indicator series across all
  38 real districts, flagging the **early-warning** outliers (district + value + z + high/low direction). The
  district structure is real (seed.Districts); the indicator values are **synthetic/illustrative** (live
  operational telemetry — attendance/dropout/FLN — is gated on the federated substrate, B-022), honestly
  declared `synthetic:true`. Deterministic. 2 integration tests.
- Verified live (dropout-risk, z=2): mean 49.6, flagged Nilgiris (91, z=4.79, high) + Ramanathapuram (22,
  z=-3.19, low). The Governance/early-warning agent surface — "surface risk in an indicator for an officer" —
  is now real over the populated estate.
- Status page: **48 modules · 417 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Policy-lever simulation (Policy agent → projection → human sanction)
- `Platform.SimulatePolicyLever(ctx, req)` — the L9 Policy agent projects a lever's **coverage/cost/equity**
  impact (L8 Policy engine, over the §D.1 1.27 Cr default population) and, because it is **high-stakes, never
  auto-adopts**: the adoption is routed to the HITL queue for a **sanctioning authority** (policy.sanction
  scope). `DecidePolicyLever` records the lever as adopted (HITL executor `policy.adopt` branch) only on human
  approval; rejection stops it. `platformd POST /policy`, GET/POST `/policy-queue`. 2 integration tests.
- Verified live: "Free-cycle scheme expansion to Class 9" (coverage 0.6, +0.25, ₹4500/unit, equity 0.8) →
  projection 60%→85%, +31.75 L newly covered, ₹14,287.5 cr, equity 0.20; requires_approval:true, queued
  TR-0001; MINISTER approves → "policy lever adopted". AI assists; the human authority decides — every decision
  reversible + audited.
- Status page: **48 modules · 419 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Compliance-findings surface (Compliance agent → statute-cited findings → human sign-off)
- `Platform.CheckCompliance(ctx, req)` — the L9 Compliance agent forward-chains a **regulatory rule base**
  (RTE 2009 §12/§16/Schedule · RPwD 2016 §16 · DPDP 2023 §6 · POCSO 2012) over a school's facts (L8 reasoning
  engine), deriving **statute-cited non-compliance findings**. Findings are **high-stakes**: routed to the HITL
  queue for a **compliance officer** (compliance.sign scope) to sign off; a clean school records no findings.
  `SignoffCompliance` records the sign-off (HITL executor `compliance.signoff` branch). `platformd POST
  /compliance` + `/compliance-signoff`. 2 integration tests.
- Verified live: a school with EWS-quota-not-met / no-accessible-infra / no-consent / detention → 4 findings
  citing DPDP §6, RPwD §16, RTE §16, RTE §12; requires_signoff:true, queued; G6-Compliance signs off (audited).
  A fully-compliant school → clean, no sign-off. The 6th agent (Compliance) is now live end-to-end.
- Status page: **48 modules · 421 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Estate-wide compliance sweep (Compliance rule base rolled up by statute + district)
- `Platform.ComplianceSweep(n)` + `platformd GET /compliance-sweep?n=` — runs the regulatory rule base
  (RTE/RPwD/DPDP/POCSO) over a deterministic sample of schools spread across the whole estate and rolls up:
  schools-checked, schools-with-findings, total findings, **by statute**, and **by district** (+
  `TopComplianceDistricts`). Read-only/analytical (the per-school HITL sign-off stays on the single-school
  check). The estate/UDISE/district are real; the compliance facts are **synthetic/illustrative** (live
  inspection data gated, B-022), declared `synthetic:true`. Refactored the finding-derivation into a shared
  `deriveComplianceFindings`. 2 integration tests.
- Verified live (n=2000): 955/2000 schools with findings (1206 total); by statute RPwD §16 (394) > RTE §12
  (290) > RTE Schedule (180) > DPDP §6 (148) > POCSO (100) > RTE §16 (94); top districts Theni/Coimbatore/
  Thoothukudi. The directorate's single compliance operating picture across the State.
- Status page: **48 modules · 423 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## CI status note
- Diagnosed the "some jobs were not successful" report: all four workflows (CI · platform · security · NodeJS-
  with-Gulp) are GREEN on the latest commits. The historical failures were (a) old CI failures on long-
  superseded commits and (b) the default "NodeJS with Gulp" starter, which was already rewritten to run the
  real tsc + next build (Node 20.x/22.x) and now passes. No current failing job.

## Built pending federation — 8 more sovereign-DPI adapters (5 → 13 of 21)
- HONEST NOTE on "build all the pending": most pending items are NOT code (physical substrate — HSM/K8s/8
  datastores/GPU/Besu/IoT/Edge; real population PII; external CAG/UNESCO audits; explicitly out-of-scope states/
  national tier). Those cannot be fabricated. The genuinely-buildable pending slice is the FEDERATION code, so:
- `platform/L4-integration/adapters` — built the 8 remaining named sovereign-DPI anti-corruption adapters
  (HRMS-TN teacher registry · IFMS-TN treasury · PM-POSHAN/CMBS mid-day-meal · ICDS Anganwadi · CBSE
  affiliation · TN State Board/DGE results · BSP/APBS DBT settlement · telco SMS DLR), each on the shared
  resilient `core` (breaker + bounded retry) with a DTO → domain ACL transform. 8 tests (httptest). Live
  endpoints/creds still gated on MoUs (B-022) — the code is ready to plug in.
- NDEAR-S register updated: REG-TEACHER (→HRMS) and FIN-DBT (→BSP/APBS) move from pending to federated →
  **28/29 addressed** (only ID-AUTH/Keycloak pending, infra B-010). Conformance diff updated: L4 adapters
  **13 of 21** (was 5).
- Status page: **48 modules · 431 tests**. Green bar: 48 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Built the absent tech-fabric seams — Edge CRDT (L2) + IoT mesh (L4) + deployment skeleton
- `platform/L2-infrastructure/edge` — offline-first **CRDT sync** (LWWRegister · GCounter · ORSet add-wins);
  state-based, conflict-free, converges with **no coordinator + no lost writes** (K3s/Pi5 hardware gated B-010).
  4 tests incl. convergence + add-wins. Fills the L2 layer (previously YAML-only).
- `platform/L4-integration/iot` — IoT-mesh **telemetry ingestion**: classify (biometric attendance = Class-1)
  → **residency gate** (offshore Class-1 quarantined, never stored) → timeseries `Sink` seam → audit; plus a
  device `Fleet` with **OTA** roll-out (online devices update; offline reconcile on reconnect). 2 tests.
- Wired: `Platform.IngestTelemetry/TelemetryStored/OTARollout/FirmwareSpread/EdgeConvergenceDemo`; platformd
  `POST /iot`, `GET /iot-ota`, `GET /edge`. 3 integration tests. Verified live: offshore biometric → quarantined
  (Class-1 residency); OTA v2 → BIO-1 (online), spread {v1:2,v2:1}; edge 28+31 → converged 59, consistent,
  add-wins APAAR-2 survives.
- **Deployment skeleton** (one `apply` from the substrate): `platform/deploy/k8s/platformd.yaml` (Namespace +
  Deployment + Service + HPA, non-root/read-only-rootfs/caps-dropped, readiness `/readiness` liveness
  `/healthz`, HPA→240 app replicas per the L10 capacity model) and a Helm chart `deploy/helm/platformd`.
- Status page: **50 modules · 440 tests**. Green bar: 50 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Built the last absent tech-fabric element — Education DAOs (advisory to statutory authority)
- `platform/L11-governance/dao` — SMC (School Management Committee) councils whose members hold
  **NON-TRANSFERABLE soulbound badges** (TransferBadge always errors), deliberating proposals by
  one-member-one-vote with **quorum + threshold**. The defining rule: a passed proposal is **ADVISORY ONLY**
  (`Advisory=true, NeedsRatify=true`) — the council recommends, the statutory authority decides. Besu/Snapshot
  substrate gated (B-020). 3 module tests (soulbound non-transfer · members-only/one-vote · quorum/threshold).
- Wired: `Platform.DemoCouncilVote` runs a council deliberation and routes a passed (advisory) proposal to the
  **HITL queue** for the head teacher/BEO to **ratify** (`RatifyCouncil`, council.ratify scope; executor
  `council.ratify` branch). `platformd GET /council` + `POST /council-ratify`. 1 integration test. Verified
  live: SMC passes 3-1 (75%), advisory + needs_ratify, queued TR-0001; HEAD_TEACHER ratifies → audited.
- Status page: **51 modules · 444 tests**. Green bar: 51 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.
- MILESTONE: every advanced-tech-fabric element with an application-code dimension is now built —
  ML(analytics) · DL-seam · IoT mesh · Blockchain-analogue(notary) · NFT-analogue(credentials) · **Education
  DAOs** · Edge compute(CRDT) · RAG+MCP. Remaining pending is purely substrate/procurement/real-data/audits.

## Deepened the school taxonomy — every school classified across 5 TN dimensions
- `seed/schooltypes.go` — canonical TN school-taxonomy master data: **SchoolLevels** (Primary 1–5 · Upper-
  Primary 1–8 · High 1–10 · Higher-Secondary 1–12, grade spans), **SchoolCategories** (8 management forms:
  Government · Aided · Matriculation · Private-CBSE · Private-Unaided · Central(KV/JNV) · Social-Welfare ·
  Municipal), **Mediums** (Tamil-first), **GenderTypes** (Co-ed/Girls/Boys), **ResidentialTypes** (Day/
  Residential/KGBV). 1 test.
- `population` — every one of the 69,000 materialised schools is now stamped on **all five dimensions**
  (management · level+grades · medium · gender · residential) at realistic TN distributions; `Summary` rolls up
  all five mixes; `FilterSchools(SchoolFilter)` queries across them. Tests assert each mix covers all 69,000 +
  realistic shape (Government/Primary/Tamil/Co-ed/Day pluralities, Girls schools + KGBV present).
- Surfaced: `Platform.SchoolsMatching` + enriched `PopulationSummary`; `platformd GET /population?district=&
  management=&level=&medium=&gender=&residential=` (deep filter) and a new open-data `schools-by-type.csv`
  (level × management cross-tab) export. 3 integration tests. Verified live: full 5-dimension mix over 69,000;
  Girls Hr-Sec in Chennai → 104 matches; schools-by-type CSV cross-tab.
- Status page: green. Green bar: 51 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## School 360 / institutional profile (the institution counterpart to the student journey)
- `Platform.SchoolProfile(udise)` — assembles a school's complete auditable record across the layers: the full
  **taxonomy classification** (management · level+grades · medium · gender · residential), its **T0–T6
  governance chain** (`GovernancePath` + owning directorate/district/block/cluster), its **IoT device fleet**
  (`fleet.DevicesAt`), a **compliance snapshot** (rule base over the school's facts → compliant iff no
  findings), and the **count of audit records** concerning it. The estate is indexed by UDISE once (lazy map)
  for O(1) lookup. `SchoolComplianceSignoff` is the actionable variant (findings → HITL officer sign-off).
  Added `iot.Fleet.DevicesAt`; anchored the demo IoT fleet to real estate schools. `platformd GET
  /school?udise=`. 3 integration tests.
- Verified live: Chennai school 33030004181 → Government Primary (1–5), Tamil/Co-ed/Day, governance path
  "TN (Sovereign) → Secretariat → DSE → Chennai → Block → Cluster → School", directorate/district/block/cluster
  resolved; school 33010000001 → 2 IoT devices (BIO-1 biometric + ENV-1 environment).
- Status page: green. Green bar: 51 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Teacher / staff onboarding via HRMS (the staff counterpart to APAAR student enrolment)
- `Platform.OnboardTeacher(ctx, TeacherOnboarding)` — HRMS-anchored staff onboarding end-to-end, fail-closed:
  **reconciles** the upstream HRMS identity (emp-id + name identity-critical) against the school's submitted
  record via the L4 comparator and **blocks on critical drift**; requires the **posting school to exist in the
  T0–T6 estate** (district resolved from its T3 ancestor); records the **§7 employment lawful basis** (HRMS
  service record, 50y retention); issues a **verifiable, notarised ServiceRecord credential** that lands in the
  staff member's wallet. Added the `staff-hrms` consent purpose. `platformd POST /staff-onboard`. 3 integration
  tests.
- Verified live: clean → onboarded:true, reconciled:true, district Chennai, service credential minted +
  wallet-verifiable; name mismatch → refused, critical_drift 1 ("Identity-critical drift on Name — verify…");
  unknown school → refused. The L4 HRMS adapter, reconcile, L6 tenancy, §E employment basis, L7 credentials +
  notary and L5 audit all interlock — and the platform now onboards BOTH students (APAAR) and staff (HRMS).
- Status page: green. Green bar: 51 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Teacher 360 / service-record view (completes the student · school · teacher triad of 360 views)
- `Platform.TeacherProfile(empID)` — the staff-360 record assembled across the layers: the §E **employment
  lawful basis**, the **postings** derived from the verifiable ServiceRecord credentials (`CurrentPosting` = the
  non-revoked, verifying one), the full **verifiable wallet**, and the **audit timeline** (reconstructed from
  the L5 chain, re-verified). Read-only + derived. `platformd GET /staff?emp=`. 3 integration tests.
- Verified live (after onboarding E-1001 at a Chennai school): found:true, lawful basis staff-hrms/employment,
  current_posting SVC-E-1001-33030004181 (PG Assistant, teaching, valid), wallet 1 cred all_valid, audit
  timeline [staff.onboard], chain verified. A revoked posting (transfer/retire) leaves the history but no
  current posting — same trust model as the student wallet.
- The platform now has all three 360 views: **student journey** (learner) · **school profile** (institution) ·
  **teacher profile** (staff) — each a single auditable record assembled live across L1–L12.
- Status page: green. Green bar: 51 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Sovereign Operations Console (super-admin for the entire VASA-EOS-SE-TN platform)
- `Platform.SovereignConsole(actorRole)` — the T0 super-admin operating picture of the WHOLE platform, role-
  gated (SUPERADMIN/SECRETARY/MINISTER): off-switch state · live conformance (12 layers · 7 G-tiers · 6/6
  engines/agents · 13 portals · 391 modules) · tenancy estate (73,232 nodes · 69,000 schools · valid) · NDEAR
  28/29 · model-card SLA · the §F.2 SLA board · civic backlog (grievances/RTI) · audit+notary tamper-evidence
  counters · a computed `go_live_ready`. **Fail-closed**: a non-super-admin gets an unauthorised, empty console
  (nothing disclosed). Plus the T0 **kill-switch** as super-admin-only actions (`SovereignDisable/Enable`,
  audited; non-super-admin denied). `platformd GET /sovereign?role=` (403 if unauthorised) + `POST
  /sovereign-offswitch`. 2 integration tests.
- Verified live: SUPERADMIN → full picture, go_live_ready:true; TEACHER → HTTP 403, authorised:false, 0 nodes;
  off-switch — TEACHER denied, SECRETARY engages → off_switch_engaged:true, go_live_ready:false.
- Status page: green. Green bar: 51 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors.

## Jurisdiction-scoped officer operating dashboard (CRC/BEO/DEO/Director)
- `Platform.OfficerDashboard(nodeID)` — the field-officer counterpart to the sovereign console: the operating
  picture of ONLY the schools a tenant node governs, via the T0–T6 **downward-governance scope**
  (`LeavesUnder(node, 6)`). For each governed school it rolls up the full 5-dimension taxonomy mix
  (management · level · medium · gender · residential), runs the regulatory **compliance sweep**
  (RTE 2009 / RPwD 2016 / DPDP 2023 / POCSO 2012, statute-cited) and counts IoT devices — all scoped to the
  subtree. A district officer sees their district; a block officer sees their block; **nobody sees outside
  their subtree** (an unknown node resolves to nothing — fail-closed). `platformd GET /officer?node=` (404 if
  unknown). 3 integration tests (district scope == governance scope · every mix sums to the governed schools ·
  block strictly narrower than its district · unknown node discloses nothing).
- Verified live: `/officer?node=TN-DIST-Chennai` → tier District, governance_path T0→Secretariat→DSE→Chennai,
  2,090 schools governed, mixes summing to 2,090 (Tamil 1,362 · Govt 1,357 · Primary 1,154 · Co-ed 1,778 …),
  compliance sweep citing all six statutes across 1,032 schools-with-findings; unknown node → HTTP 404.
- Status page: green. Green bar: 51 Go modules pass, OPA 33/33, tsc 0 errors. 463 tests.
